      <h1>About Us – OBSYDIA</h1>

      <h2>We don’t chase trends.</h2>
      <h2>We don’t shout with logos.</h2>
      <h2>We don’t believe color is a requirement.</h2>

     <h2> OBSYDIA began with a simple conviction: the deepest aesthetic is the one that disappears. Black is not the absence of color; it is the event horizon—everything is pulled in, nothing escapes. Every shoe we make is designed to that principle.
</h2>
     <h2> From the beginning we have been obsessive about three things:
</h2>
      <h3>1. **Absolute black**</h3>
      <h4>No off-black, no charcoal, no “almost.” Every material—leather, knit, rubber, thread—is dyed, treated, or engineered to the same void-level black. Triple-black is not a colorway. It is the only colorway.
</h4>
      <h3>2. **Silence**</h3>
      <h4>No visible branding on the outside. The name appears once, debossed or absent entirely. The shoe should speak louder when nothing is written on it.
</h4>
      <h3>3. **Reduction**
 </h3> <h4>    Every unnecessary seam, overlay, or gimmick is removed. What remains is structure, proportion, and craft. Comfort is non-negotiable, but never at the cost of the form.
</h4>
     <h4> We are a small team of designers, engineers, and craftsmen who spent years working inside some of the biggest names in footwear. We left because we were tired of seasonal noise. OBSYDIA is the result: a permanent collection that evolves slowly, deliberately, and only when it needs to.
</h4>
      <h4>This is not streetwear.
     </h4> 
     <h4>This is not high fashion.
 </h4> <h4>    This is the footwear equivalent of a black hole—inescapable, timeless, and quietly inevitable.
</h4>
    <h4>  Welcome to the void.
     </h4> <h4>Step accordingly.
